# hospital-vacancy

A flask based web application to manage the vacancy in hospitals.

This project is being made under Topcoder Hackathon IIT Mandi.

## Description
- Problem:
    The government hospitals have no proper portal where the patients can see if there are slots available.
    We also know that most of the population of India is dependent on the Government Hospitals.
    They don't even know if the hospital they are going to, can accommodate them.
-  Solution:
    We have made a Hospital Vacancy Status System in which users can see the slots available in each hospital.
    The Hospitals can create account on the Portal and set/update the vacant slots of beds, ICU Beds and rooms.
    The Hospitals may add the doctors along with their specializations so that the users may have details for the same.
